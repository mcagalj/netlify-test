# "Hello, World!" program

[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Because it is very simple in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language and is often the first program people write.

While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book The C Programming Language.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( ) {
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
